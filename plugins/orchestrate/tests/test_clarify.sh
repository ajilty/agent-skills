# Tier 3c — the router's intake-clarification decision is JOURNALED (§2b), so it
# becomes a checkable trace instead of invisible router-context behavior. Today a
# clarification skill runs in router context and leaves NO ledger event, so nothing
# can verify it fired. `ledger.sh clarify <skill> [ticket]` records the decision
# (which skill was selected, first-present-wins), and the conformance checker can then
# assert it happened on an ambiguous goal.
