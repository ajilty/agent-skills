# Tier 3a — mechanical invocation against a LIVE local agent session. Proves the
# harness actually dispatches the right subagent and runs its tools — the one layer
# unit tests can't reach (they test hook scripts in isolation, not whether CC invokes
# them). Inherently model-dependent → gated (not per-push), and best-effort: a fixed
# prompt forces the actuator + a Bash probe, which a capable model performs reliably.
#
# Isolation: temp cwd (the .agents/ ledger + any project .claude/ land in a throwaway
# repo) — pure filesystem isolation, no harness-config knob. Auth: a real local
# session (OAuth in ~/.claude) OR ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; skipped if neither is present.
