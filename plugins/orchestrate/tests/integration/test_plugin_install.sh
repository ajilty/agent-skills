# Tier 2 — plugin-install smoke against the REAL `claude` CLI, at BOTH user scope and
# project (repo) scope. No API key needed: validate/marketplace/install/details make
# no model calls. Filesystem-isolated at the HOME+cwd level (not via CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
# / --scope-as-isolation): every `claude` runs with HOME and cwd pointed at throwaway
# dirs, so user-scope state (HOME/.claude) AND project-scope state (cwd/.claude) and
# the plugin cache all land in the sandbox — nothing touches the repo or real ~/.claude.
# Proves Claude Code ingests the packaged plugin and persists the enable at the right
# scope (the install gap the zero-dep suite can't reach).
