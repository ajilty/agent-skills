# Tier 3 (Codex clarify-gate precondition, deterministic) — the O6 front-door clarify-gate
# selects a clarification mechanism by FIRST-PRESENT down grill-with-docs -> grill-me ->
# brainstorming -> inline (SKILL §2b). On a stock Codex install only `find-skills` ships in
# ~/.codex/skills; grill-me / brainstorming are NOT present. Per ADR-0015 the gate must
# therefore fall through to `inline` (a non-interactive session's clarification is still a
# clarification). This asserts the PRECONDITION that makes that fall-through faithful: the
# sandbox CODEX_HOME skills dir genuinely lacks grill-me AND brainstorming. If a future
# install seeds them, this fixture flags that the gate would no longer fall to inline.
