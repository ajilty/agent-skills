# Tier 3c (live) — TRACE CONFORMANCE end-to-end: drive a REAL minimal chain and assert
# the choreography actually fired on the real harness. This is the live half of the
# "watch the skills execute when expected" eval: the deterministic test_conformance.sh
# proves the checker discriminates conformant vs degraded traces; this proves a real
# orchestrate chain PRODUCES a conformant trace on the actual CC dispatch path (the
# exact thing the namespaced-persona / dead-SubagentStart bugs silently broke).
#
# Router sets the active-writer record, then drives: dispatch implementer (the
# writer_writeahead hook auto-journals `dispatched`) -> dispatch verifier -> append the
# verdict in-loop (as the real router does). Then `ledger.sh conformance
# dispatched:implementer verdict` must pass against the REAL board.jsonl. Robust to
# model nondeterminism: skip if the chain didn't run.
