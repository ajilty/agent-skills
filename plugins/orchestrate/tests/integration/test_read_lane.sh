# Tier 3 (live) — FULL read lane. THE proactive catch for the result-channel bug
# class (ADR-0014): the automated test the field failure slipped past because no
# test ran a real read-only dispatch and asserted its substantive result is durably
# retrievable FROM DISK, independent of the chat/notification channel. The writer
# lane proved writes land as commits; this proves reads land as files.
#
# A real researcher is dispatched to investigate a known local fact and WRITE its
# findings to the scoped quarantine path (the disk-first read lane). We then read
# that file straight off disk — never the agent's chat reply — and assert it carries
# the answer + the completion sentinel at the attributed path (slug.dispatch_id).
# That is the whole claim: a dropped/mislabeled/never-replayed notification can no
# longer lose a finding. Robust to model-decline (skips).
