# Tier 3c (live) — TEST THE ROUTER: on an ambiguous goal, the router must recognize the
# ambiguity, SELECT the first-present clarification skill (§2b, first-present-wins), and
# JOURNAL that decision (`ledger.sh clarify <skill>`) so it's a checkable trace. This is
# the one choreography step that was previously invisible (clarification runs in router
# context, not a persona dispatch, so it left no ledger event). We seed the sandbox HOME
# with the real clarification skills so first-present selection is faithful.
#
#   clarify event names grill-with-docs -> router selected the first-present skill: PASS
#   clarify event names another skill    -> router journaled the decision (core behavior): PASS (noted)
#   no clarify event                     -> router didn't reach/journal it this run: SKIP
