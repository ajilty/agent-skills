# Tier 3c (live) — TEST THE GATE JUDGMENT (O6 front-door clarify-gate, §2b). Unlike
# test_clarify_lane (which instructs the router to journal a clarify, testing plumbing),
# this tests the JUDGMENT: give a bare goal with NO hint to clarify, and see whether the
# gate fires on its own at the right time.
#
# Case FUZZY: a goal with no acceptance oracle nameable as-stated ("add rate limiting" —
#   limit/scope/backend/response-code all unstated). The gate MUST fire: a `clarify` event
#   must appear BEFORE any implementer dispatch (err-toward-asking), and ideally the lane
#   HALTs (no implementer at all) since the session is non-interactive. The failure this
#   guards is real and was observed in a probe BEFORE the gate existed: a premium Planner
#   invents a plausible-but-wrong spec and an Implementer builds it with zero clarify (the
#   silent-rework mode). Implementer-with-no-clarify on a fuzzy goal = the gate FAILED.
#
# Case CLEAR: a fully-specified spec. The gate must NOT over-fire — no `clarify` before
#   the first dispatch — or every clear goal pays an interruption tax (the O7 failure mode).
#
# We seed the real clarification skills so first-present selection is faithful.
#
# FUZZY runs K times (CLARIFY_GATE_K, default 1): a silent build is a hard FAIL, all
# declines SKIP, and under K>1 a minority fire-rate FAILs (catches a gate that mostly
# declines when it should ask). Each fire also asserts the §2b HEADLESS contract: the
# journaled clarify skill must be `inline` (formal grill skills can't interview with no
# human), and journaling a formal skill headless is a mislabel -> FAIL. We do NOT assert
# a formal grill skill "executed": headless it can't (no human), so that is designed-zero,
# not a gap — interactive grilling is out of scope for an automated test by construction.
