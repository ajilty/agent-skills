# reground's READ-ONLY branch (ADR-0014). Previously this branch (ledger.sh) printed
# a generic "re-dispatch if artifact absent" line WITHOUT ever checking disk — it was
# the one re-dispatch decision with NO test. With the disk-first read lane the result
# is a durable file, so reground must key the re-dispatch decision on its presence:
#   findings/<slug>.md ABSENT  -> open lane, re-dispatch (no result on disk)
#   findings/<slug>.md PRESENT -> satisfied, do not re-dispatch
# A read-only lane is NEVER an ambiguous-writer HALT (exit 0 either way).
