# Tier 3c — VERIFICATION IS NOT OPTIONAL (the enforcement half). The infra-log analysis
# showed the router self-verifies inline and ships without a Verifier. Teaching alone
# (context-economy §2a′, §2b) didn't override that pull, so `ledger.sh done <ticket>` is
# FAIL-CLOSED: a verifying lane (T1/T2) may not be marked done without a verdict on the
# board. T0 (one Implementer vs the oracle — the oracle IS the check) is exempt. Unknown
# tier -> require a verdict (fail-closed). This makes "ship unverified" impossible, not
# just discouraged.
